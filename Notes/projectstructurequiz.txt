Standard project structure
 
What files and folders are there?
 
(from memory):
master >
  config >
    -database.yml
  db >
    -setup.rb
    migrate >
      -.keep
      -(whatever migrations are generated by rakefile)
  lib >
    -(ruby files to include on each run)
    -.keep
-play/execute/whatever the main operation file is, so that it doesn't run every time
-.gitignore, containing DS.Store, coverage, etc.
-Rakefile
-Gemfile
-Gemfile.lock
 
(not from memory):
-README.md
-console.rb
 
What does each one do?
  -config contains the database.yml file, which sets up a connection with the specified database (?)
  -setup.rb loads the specified database to get configuration information
  -migrate houses the different migrations/tables that are set up by rake:generate migration (name)
  -migrate also contains a .keep file, which I think makes it so that empty folders are visible..?
  -lib houses all the .rb files that need to be included for the program to run, making it easy to include them all
  -.gitignore keeps unwanted files from getting pushed 
  -Rakefile automates a lot of commands, including generate and migrate
  -Gemfile is a file that manages dependencies; is a list of needed gems (then run bundler to check that all are there
