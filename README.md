| "Did you know? The collective noun for a group of programmers is a merge-conflict" - [@omervk](https://twitter.com/abt_programming/status/445962345064714240)

We're going to use this repository to practice ~~trampling all over each other's work~~collaborating.

Each student should:

* clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:TIY-DC-ROR-2015-Jan/merge-conflict.git`
* update the `pyramid` (see below)
* add any best things to the `best` folder and fix any existing wrong bests (ex. clearly Cool Runnings is a better sledding movie than Citizen Kane).
* add, commit, and push their changes
* resolve any conflicts that arise

## The Pyramid scheme

The idea of the pyramid file is for each person to add themselves to the bottom of the file, and add a dot to each person above them. So the file might start as:

```
James ·
```

then if Su adds hers next, she would update it to:

```
James ··
   Su ·
```

and Kyle would add:

```
James ···
   Su ··
 Kyle ·
```

and so on.
